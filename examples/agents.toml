# Example agents.toml configuration file
# Copy to ~/.config/qq/agents.toml to customize agent behavior
#
# Built-in agents: chat, researcher, summarizer, coder, reviewer, explore, planner, writer
#
# Configuration options:
#   max_turns      - Maximum number of agentic loop turns per invocation
#   tool_limits    - Per-tool call limits (tool_name -> max_calls)
#   compact_prompt - Custom prompt for summarizing agent memory when it exceeds budget
#
# When a limit is reached, the agent receives an error prompting it to complete.
#
# NOTE: All agents automatically have access to `inform_user` - a tool that sends
# status messages to the user without ending the agent's turn. Use it to keep
# users informed during long-running tasks (e.g., "Searching codebase...",
# "Delegating to researcher..."). No configuration needed.
