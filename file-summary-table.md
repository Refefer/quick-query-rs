Implements `InternalAgent` (max turns = 100) and provides comprehensive tests. |
| crates/qq-agents/src/reviewer.rs | Implements **ReviewerAgent**, an autonomous code reviewer. System prompt covers review process, severity categories, and required tools (`read_file`, `find_files`, `search_files`). Implements `InternalAgent` (max turns = 100) with a detailed tool description and tests. |
| crates/qq-agents/src/summarizer.rs | Implants **SummarizerAgent**, which creates tailored content summaries. System prompt guides summarization styles (executive, action‑focused, problem‑focused, learning‑focused). No tools needed; max turns = 100. Includes tool description and unit tests. |
| crates/qq-agents/src/writer.rs | Implements **WriterAgent**, a documentation generator. System prompt stresses specifying output destinations (file path or return as response) and writing strategies. Tools: `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, etc., with limits. Implements `InternalAgent` (max turns = 100) and provides tests. |
| crates/qq-cli/README.md | Describes the `qq-cli` crate: binary that aggregates all other crates, loads TOML config, creates providers/tools/agents, supports one‑shot, interactive chat/TUI, and legacy readline mode. Covers installation, quick start commands, CLI reference options (prompt, profile, model, system prompt, temperature, etc.) and detailed TUI architecture. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/agents/agent_tool.rs | Provides **InternalAgentTool** & **ExternalAgentTool**, wrapper tools exposing agents as callable LLM tools. Handles nesting depth, tool limits, context propagation, agent execution with continuation support, and event‑bus notifications. Includes `create_agent_tools` to generate enabled agent tools. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/agents/continuation.rs | Implements continuation logic for agents hitting `max_turns`. Generates a summary via LLM, formats it into context, re‑executes the agent up to configurable continuations. Defines configuration structs, execution result types, and safe message splitting helpers. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/agents/inform_user.rs | Defines **InformUserTool**, allowing agents to send non‑blocking status messages to the user via the event bus (`UserNotification` events). Implements argument parsing, tool definition with required `message`, and execution that publishes notifications. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/agents/mod.rs | Re‑exports agent tools & continuation types. Also re‑exports internal agents from `qq-agents`. Defines **AgentExecutor** to build tool subsets per agent, run internal/external agents, list enabled agents, check existence, and provides async execution helpers with tests. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/chat.rs | Implements interactive chat (readline mode). Manages messages, system prompt, context compaction (LLM summarization or truncation), tool execution, streaming responses, markdown rendering, tool call display, debug logging, command parsing (`/help`, `/quit`, etc.). Provides utilities for byte formatting, RSS measurement, safe message splitting, and continuation support. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/config.rs | Defines CLI configuration: loads `config.toml` (profiles, providers, prompts, tools), resolves layered overrides (TOML → env → CLI flags), provides helpers to retrieve active profile settings, provider configurations, and tool toggles. Includes validation and defaults. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/debug_log.rs | Implements **DebugLogger**, optional file‑based logger for detailed diagnostics: logs conversation start, iteration info, messages sent/received, tool calls/results, token usage, final assistant output. Enabled via `--debug-file` flag. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/event_bus.rs | Provides asynchronous event bus (`AgentEventBus`) using Tokio broadcast channels. Defines events (tool start/complete, progress updates, user notifications, continuation) enabling agents and UI to publish/subscribe in real time. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/execution_context.rs | Tracks nested execution stack of agents for proper scoping. Allows pushing/popping agent names, retrieving current scope path, and integrates with per‑agent memory handling. |
| crates/qq-cli/src/main.rs | CLI entry point (`clap`).
